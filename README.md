[![EC2 Private DNS to IPs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashwanthkumar/chrome-ec2.internal/master/icons/256.png)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ip-x-x-x-xec2internal-to/fjgpmnicfiedkeikinlmbpjloefhgnef)

If you've ever been frustrated by the `.ec2.internal` domain names on your hadoop / spark clusters? Especially when you want to view the Task logs and the chrome shows you "DNS not resolved"? 

STOP manually editing the location on the address bar. This plugin will do that for you.

### Chrome-Store
It's available at chrome web store over [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ip-x-x-x-xec2internal-to/fjgpmnicfiedkeikinlmbpjloefhgnef)
